# hello-world
My first repository on Git hub. Baby steps to programming mastery.

Hi Humans, I am a novie programmer that knows or feels that he is capable of much much more. Always liked programming but never pursued it diligently. Trying to change it now.

Competitive programming. Software development. Trying out new languages and frameworks.
Building applications for making the world a better place, and a little bit of money, not much, just enough for proper video gaming and gymming :)
